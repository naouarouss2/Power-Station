# Power Station
## What is it ? ⚡
A custom built lab bench power supply, based on an old ATX PSU.
## Why did I make it ? 🛠️
I really love robotics, but the problem I always encounter when prototyping, is how to power on my circuits.

Previously, I used some 18650 batteries and a buck converter, but this is a pretty painful and time-consuming process.

And since my friend gave me an old ATX power supply, I decided to turn it into my own, custom built, lab bench power supply, which I called **Power Station**
## Features ✅
-  350W total power output
-  3.3V Output
-  5V Outputs
-  12V Outputs
-  Protection fuses
It has a SK150C module that offers :
-  A 150W 0.5-40V @ 0-8A variable output
-  A Bluetooth interface
-  A battery charging circuit feature
-  A small TFT screen to show some graphs and values regarding the variable power output and battery charging
