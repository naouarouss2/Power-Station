# Power Station
## What is it ? ⚡
A custom built lab bench power supply, based on an old ATX PSU.
## Why did I make it ? 🛠️
I really love robotics, but the problem I always encounter when prototyping, is how to power on my circuits.

Previously, I used some 18650 batteries and a buck converter, but this is a pretty painful and time-consuming process.

And since my friend gave me an old ATX power supply, I decided to turn it into my own, custom built, lab bench power supply, which I called **Power Station**
## Features ✅
